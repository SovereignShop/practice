What is the composition relelationship?

*** Answer

Composition relationships are part-whole relationships where the part must
constitute part of the whole object. For example, a heart is a part of a
person’s body. The part in a composition can only be part of one object at a
time. A heart that is part of one person’s body can not be part of someone
else’s body at the same time.

What properties must be true of an object and a part for a relationship to be
a composition?

*** Answer

To qualify as a composition, an object and a part must have the following relationship:
- The part (member) is part of the object (class)
- The part (member) can only belong to one object (class) at a time
- The part (member) has its existence managed by the object (class)
- The part (member) does not know about the existence of the object (class)
